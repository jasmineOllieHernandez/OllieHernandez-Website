        <p class="lead mb-4">I love to be creative and share my passions with people of all kinds. Due to my hobby, I decided to create a small business that would allow me my own freedoms
        to express myself and share my passion for art. While it is a blast to do what you love, it can be tiring when it comes to creating new samples and quality checking before selling
        them on my shop. I am always taking advice and suggestions from my buyers to see what I can do to improve or what future types of products they would like to see. I take great pride
        being able to package every order carefully and making sure I add some extras to show my appreciation for their support. My small business has been my main focus due to how easily manageable
        it is while being a full time university student. Since starting in 2019, I have been able to test out multiple materials as well as improved my communication skills between my manufacturers and myself. Being able
        to make sure stock arrives on time and is on par with the quality I am aiming for. With the increasing amount of orders, I have had to buy and learn new tools such as a cutting machine as well as lamination machines. These
         tools have been investments but have made my job easier, as it is only me who manages the shop. I was able to take a step further by particpating in anime conventions by selling at their Artist Alleys, allowing me to promote
        my merchandise in person, as well as showing a growth in my social media. Due to COVID-19, a lot of my plans involving tabling at other Californian conventions was halted due to everything closing. Since then, I have 
        had to open up an online shop and try to promote as much as possible through social media. I still have little to no confidence with how the world is operating, but I am hoping that once the safety improves 
        I will focus on selling in person again. I had the biggest boom late 2021, which required me to seek help from my family members when it came to packaging as well as only having a small desk space.
      <br><br>

        My previous work have always involved assisting people and informing them of services offered by either the Youth Center or Library. I would be given tasks to create posters and flyers to advertise upcoming programs
        as well as assisting with movie night and craft-based programs. Library duties would require me to reorganize books, DVDs, and assiting individuals to utilize computer and printing services. Another would be to 
        maintain the peaceful and quiet atmosphere, requiring I speak to individuals who may be disrupting those around them. At times, I would be asked to organize books that will be sold by the library for low prices, making sure labels are removed and books are in 
        good condition.<br><br>

        Working as an intern at the UCLA Youth Source Center gave me a glimpse into office work, as well as how to properly interact with incoming individuals. Learning proper etiquette when 
        answering the phone, disposing of documents with senstitive information, as well as learning what the Youth Center offers to relay to individuals. I would be in charge of inputting 
        information into the online database being used and updating files that required. The Youth Center also gave me an oppurtunity to use my creativity when it came to creating posters and flyers, as well
         as decorating the office for upcoming programs or holidays.
